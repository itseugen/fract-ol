How to use my fractol program:
./fractol <type> <iter:<number>> <colour> <creal:<number>> <cimg:<number>>

replace type with:
	mandelbrot
	julia
	burning_ship
leave type empty to display mandelbrot set

replace iter with:
	iter:<number>
	and replace number with the amount of iterations you want to start the fractal with 
	(too big or too small numbers will look bad and big numbers might increase render times (by a lot))
	the number has to be an valid integer and bigger than 0

replace colour with:
	rainbow
	shift
	tuvalu
	india
leave empty for a standart colour scheme
only one colour input will be tolerated

replace creal with:
	creal:<number>
	and replace number with the real part of the complex julia number
leave empty for standart values, only works if the julia set is chosen

replace cimg with:
	cimg:<number>
	and replace number with the imaginary part of the complex julia number
leave empty for standart values, only works if the julia set is chosen

All arguments can be in whatever order.

Use the 'z'-key to activate zooming on the cursor and use 'x' to deactivate it (active by default)
if deactivate you will zoom to the middle of the fractol

HINT: The more pixels in the set (the black pixels in the middle of the normal colour scheme) are
visible, the longer the rendering might take.
