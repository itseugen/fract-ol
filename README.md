## It has the following features:
- Displaying the [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set "Link to Wikipedia") set.
- Plotting the [Burning ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal "Link to Wikipedia") set.
- Creating a [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set "Link to Wikipedia") set with custom parameters.
- Zooming in on the mouse cursor.
- Moving the set with the arrow or WASD keys.
- Displaying the set in five different colour schemes.

## Notes:
- This project was made using the [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42 "Link to the github of the library") graphics Library.
- It also used my [own C Library](https://github.com/itseugen/c_library "Link to my own github").
- The project (for now) only works on MacOS, glfw needs to be installed.
